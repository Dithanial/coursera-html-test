  <h1>Fun Steps In This Assignment!</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
      <div class="box">
        <p id="t1" class="title">Fun Step 10</p>
        <p>Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. For a visual reference of this view, see the tablet mockup illustration below.</p> 
      </div>  
    </section>


    <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
      <div class="box">
        <p id="t2" class="title">Fun Step 12</p>
        <p>Section title region: Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). Copy the titles from the mockup illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own. (Hint: use relative and absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22.)</p>

    <section class="col-lg-4">
      <div class="box">
        <p id="t3" class="title">Fun Step 14</p>
        <p>Borders and Colors: Each section should have a background color set to some color (of your choosing). Set the background color of each section title region to some unique color (of your choosing). Make sure that the background color still allows the user to view the text in the section and section title regions. Depending on the color you choose, you may want to change the color of the text so it can be easy to read. Set a black border on both the section and section title region that is 1px thick. </p>
